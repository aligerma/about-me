    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I love playing basketball, experimenting with new recipes, and exploring the outdoors. These hobbies help me relax and recharge. Also, I love movies, music, and books. Growing up, I was a huge Potterhead and the first place I wanted to go when I moved to the U.S was to visit Universal Studio. I love experiences so I spend most of my money on concerts, sports, travelling, and trying out new restaurants. </p>
